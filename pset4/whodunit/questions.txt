1.  stdint.h is a standard C library included to define fixed int data widths regardless of platform.
2.  The point is to have datatypes of predictable sizes, regardless of platform.
3.  BYTE is 1 byte, DWORD is 4 bytes, LONG is 4 bytes and WORD is 2 bytes.  
4.  The first two bytes of any BMP file must be 'BM'.
5.  The diffence between bfSize and biSize is : bfSize refers to the size of the bitmap file and biSize refers to the number of bytes required by the bitmap info header.
6.  If biHeight is negative, then the bitmap is a topdown DIB, and the orgin is in the upper-left corner. Otherwise, if it is positive, then it is a bottom-up DIB and its orgin is in the lower left corner.
7.  The field that specifies the BMP's color depth, in BITMAPINFOHEADER, is biBitCount.
8.  fopen might return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c because the user might specify a filename of a file that does not exist.
9.  Because we want to read in one element of the specify size at a time.
10. Copy.c assigns a value of '3' to padding if bi.biWidth is 3.
11. fseek moves the 'cursor' pointer to a specific part of a file.
12. SEEK_CUR refers to the current position of the file pointer.
